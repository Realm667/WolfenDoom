AO (AMBIENT OCLUSION)
determines which areas are inherently darkened to simulate shadows
- black are shadows
- whitre are no shadows

METALLIC
defines the ability of the surface to reflect the imagery around it
- black reflects the imagery around
- white doesn't reflect the imagery around

NORMAL MAPS
defines the illusion of depth and features
- light purple color is usually the neutral color
- more explained here: http://www.falloutsoftware.com/tutorials/gl/normal-map.html

ROUGHNESS
defines the ability of the surface to reflect or absorb white light
- white makes the texture matte (rough)
  (as the lights remitted in all directions, good for bland surfaces)
- black makes the texture shiny (smooth)
  (as the light gets reflected, good for polished surfaces)

SPECULAR MAPS
Specular maps are the maps you use to define a surface's shininess and highlight colour.
The higher the value of a pixel (from black to white), the shinier the surface will appear on scene.
Therefore, surfaces such as dry stone or cotton fabric would tend to have a very dark specular map,
while surfaces like polished chrome or plastic would tend to have lighter specular maps.
The colour of a pixel is also used, to calculate the resulting colour of the surface.
A very saturated specular map will have a very different visual effect than a grey specular map.
If you need a more "neutral" highlight on a surface, your specular map should use the inverse of the diffuse map's colour.
Using the same colour on the specular as on the diffuse will result in a more saturated highlight when viewed in the scene.
You can use contrasts in specular to make a surface appear more visually interesting in the scene.
