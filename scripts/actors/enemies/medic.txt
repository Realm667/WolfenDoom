/*

  An actor that looks for dead 'Nazi' class actors to be healed.

  Automatically searches for the closest visible dead 'Nazi' actor that it is allied with (that
  has the same FRIENDLY flag settings) that is not gibbed or burned to ash.  Once the actor is
  identified, the Medic sets the actor as its goal and runs to it.

  Once within range of the goal actor (24 units centerpoint to centerpoint), the Medic enters its
  "Heal" state and begins to resurrect the dead actor.

  While the dead actor is being healed, "HealingParticle" actors are spawned from the dead actor.
  The number of particles spawned, and the number of repetitions of the "Heal" state animation that
  are played, is based on the spawn health of the dead actor; one iteration of the heal animation
  (5 particle spawns) for every 25 hitpoints, with a maximum of 3 iterations.

  The now ressurected actor's target is cleared, and, if they are sneakable, they are set idle.

  The Medic also tries to avoid the player, by running away if a player is visible within 192
  units.  When this happens, the medic also forgets what dead body it was going toward.

  Also can work as FRIENDLY, healing only the FRIENDLY dead actors.
