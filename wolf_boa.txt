Description 		: Blade of Agony is a story-driven FPS. The project is inspired by WWII shooters 
			  from the 90's and early 2000's, like Wolfenstein 3D, Medal of Honor, and Call 
			  of Duty, but with faster-paced gameplay in the spirit of Doom! The game can 
			  be played standalone using the GZDoom engine as a base.

Story			: It's 1944, and the war approaches its peak. The U.S. has joined the Allied forces, 
			  and the Soviets are pushing back the front in the east. The tides of war are 
			  turning, and Hitler's victory seems more and more beyond his grasp. But the 
			  Nazis, refusing to capitulate, have grown obsessed with human experiments and 
		  	  occult artifacts, in which they see a potential escape from their final Doom. 
			  The Allied leaders reject this possibility as nonsense; nonetheless, some still 
			  fear what the Führer might be up to. The situation is nebulous, however, and little 
			  is certain.

			  You are Cpt. William "B.J." Blazkowicz, an Allied spy, a fearless risk-taker, and 
			  the greatest soldier to ever take up arms in World War II. Your role has changed, 
			  though; you've retired from active duty, and now you spearhead operations as a systems 
			  analyst. You thought it would be the right choice--leading and motivating instead of 
			  doing the dirty work--but lately you've grown restless. At least until a few days ago, 
			  when you received an encrypted message from your old friend and comrade Cpt. Douglas 
			  Blake, calling you back to duty...
