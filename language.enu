I don't have a lot of time to take care of the mess hall bar since a few weeks... since your capture,... it made me mad, but that's not ze only problem.\n\n\cCMon ami, zere is a spy under us. Many of the soldiers say it must be \cQGutenberg\cC, they are already investigating his labs. He is a german traitor after all, yes, but I think zis would be too easy, too obvious.\n\n\cCZere is something strange about everyone lately, everyone seems to be suspicious and nobody trusts anyone anymore. All I can say is: Be careful, think ahead, be attentive and take care William, please take care of yourself.";

BARKEEPERLIVE01 = "\cCBonsoir, mon ami. I am glad to see you alive. I knew my secret mechanism wouldn't fool you; you are too clever! But enough chatter, we must hurry! Ze \cRNazis\cC are preparing to destroy ze plaza bridge as we speak. You must not let zem! Ze enemy firmly holds ze plaza; you will find not only many on ze ground, but snipers above as well. After you save ze bridge, you must take out zese forces. Zen, you can explore and secure ze nearby buildings - we know ze enemy has connected ze \cBhotel\cC to ze catacombs, so start there. And remember, ze \cRGermans\cC won't just *give* us \cBParis\cC; zey could counter at any moment, so be ready to hold ze plaza until our *own* \cQreinforcements\cC arrive. We'll hold our position here and watch for ze enemy. I will stay in radio contact with \cQCpt. Blake\cC - he will keep you updated.";
BARKEEPERLIVE02 = "\cPWilliam\cC, zere are \cFmachine guns\cC up zere in ze streets, left over from ze fighting. Zese guns could be of good use to you, especially when ze enemy tries to retake the plaza. Remember zat you must not only hold the plaza but also defend zat \cFNebelwerfer\cC gun - it would be of much help to ze Allies, but only if we can bring it back to HQ in one piece, and ze \cRGermans\cC would prefer to destroy it! Oh, and while we speak of danger: Be alert in ze catacombs. \cBParis\cC' underground has seen... better days, and zere are all kinds of - how do you say? - 'critters' down zere. In fact, zere should be an old entrance to ze catacombs near zis hideout. Maybe it is related to ze odd keyhole just outside? Anyway, mon cher, stay alive - et bonne chance!";
BARKEEPERLIVE03 = "\cCTres bien, mon ami! \cBParis\cC is ours again, and ze \cRNazis\cC are retreating. As soon as we get back to HQ, I'll pour \cPyou\cC and \cQDouglas\cC a glass of my finest wine, oui? Hehe, you deserve it.";
