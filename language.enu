Now then, with formalities dealt with, let's discuss your first mission.";
BRIEFINGC1M1_2 = "\cCAccording to a German communique we've intercepted, the \cRNazis\cC have deployed an entire division to the outskirts of \cBTunis\cC, led by \cRGeneral Fettgesicht\cC, head of the Afrika Korps. Their goal is to establish a small outpost near an archaeological excavation site.";
BRIEFINGC1M1_3 = "\cCThe brass at \cQAllied High Command\cC find it very unusual that \cRHitler\cC would send \cRFettgesicht\cC, along with that much manpower, to a simple outpost in Tunisia, particularly at such a crucial stage of the war.";

BRIEFINGC1M1_5 = "\cCSuffice it to say, failure is not an option. You are, however, our best weapon, and if anyone can complete this mission, it's you. Time is short, so meet \cQCpt. Douglas Blake\cC outside at the gate for further specifics. You are dismissed!";

BRIEFINGC1M2_2 = "\cCWith that in mind, we cannot rest on our laurels just yet. The boys over in Intel have intercepted and decrypted an alarming message: One of our spies, \cQCaptain James Ryan\cC, was recently captured by the \cRSS\cC during a recon mission in \cBFrance\cC!";
BRIEFINGC1M2_3 = "\cCWe must free him before the \cRNazis\cC get information that could seriously hamper our war effort. Our latest intel indicates he was sent to \cRSaint-Jean\cC, a notorious high-security prison that nobody has escaped from - or attempted to break into, for that matter!";
BRIEFINGC1M2_4 = "\cCAt least, not until now. We're going to show the Jerries that their prison isn't so impenetrable after all. You are to do whatever it takes to infiltrate \cRSaint-Jean\cC, liberate \cQCpt. James Ryan\cC, and bring him back here in one piece!";
BRIEFINGC1M2_5 = "\cCAlthough you have been trained to resist interrogation, being captured by the \cRNazis\cC would surely be a fate worse than death. We're giving you a standard-issue cyanide capsule just in case, \cPBlazkowicz\cC. Speak to \cQCpt. Blake\cC before departing. You are dismissed!";

BRIEFINGC1M3_3 = "\cCThe heavily-fortified \cQAtlantic Wall\cC off the shores of \cBNormandy\cC is lined with powerful 88mm Flak guns that will turn the beachhead into a slaughtering ground. The Allies won't even have a prayer's chance of joining the battle.";
BRIEFINGC1M3_4 = "\cCIf there is to be any hope for success, you must arrive before Overlord commences and disable those \cFartillery guns\cC. Otherwise, there is no telling how many scores of our boys will be lost. The importance of your efforts cannot be stressed enough.";
BRIEFINGC1M3_5 = "\cCQuite possibly, you will have a hand in moving the tides of history. Overlord is our best chance of gaining a foothold in \cBEurope\cC, so you mustn't do any less than your absolute best! You're dismissed; report to \cQCpt. Blake\cC at once. Godspeed.";
BRIEFINGC1M3_6 = "\cCThis is it, \cPWill\cC. The big one. You know the stakes, so listen up! You'll have to locate enough \cFComp B explosives\cC in the field to take down those guns. And remember, our cruisers will be bombarding the shore, so don't get too close to the beachhead!";
BRIEFINGC1M3_7 = "\cCTry not to draw too much attention to yourself. And watch for disturbed ground, especially near chokepoints; there'll be plenty of German mines waiting for you! I hope you got a \cFmine detector\cC from \cQRojas\cC. Come back to us in one piece! Good luck!";

BRIEFINGC1M4_1 = "\cCExcellent work, \cPBlazkowicz\cC! Due to your efforts, we were able to establish a beachhead and secure our position in \cBNormandy\cC. The \cRNazis\cC have pulled back, but this war is far from over - even as we speak, Nazi armament production proceeds at full throttle.";
BRIEFINGC1M4_2 = "\cCWe must somehow hinder German manufacturing. Intel has confirmed that the hydroelectric \cBEdersee Dam\cC is one of the major power sources keeping \cRHitler\cC's war machine afloat. Destroying the dam would cripple \cRNazi\cC weapons manufacturing.";
BRIEFINGC1M4_3 = "\cCThe goal of \cBOperation: Chastise\cC is precisely that! Unfortunately, the dam is guarded by Flak guns, as well as underwater nets that render our torpedoes useless. But we have a new weapon: bouncing bombs that can skip across the water's surface like pebbles!";
BRIEFINGC1M4_4 = "\cCThe Flak guns prevent our B-29s from getting close enough to deploy these bombs; that's where you come in, \cPBlazkowicz\cC. Disable the \cFguns\cC so our B-29s can get in there and turn the dam into a pile of underwater rubble!";
BRIEFINGC1M4_5 = "\cCIf Chastise succeeds, it will be lights out for several German factories. That'll deal a fierce blow to Nazi production, which means less Panzers on the front! You're dismissed. Report now to \cQCpt. Blake\cC for further instructions.";
BRIEFINGC1M4_6 = "\cCWhen I was a kid, I'd practice skipping stones across any creek or pond I could find. I wouldn't have thought you could do the same thing with bombs! I guess we'll find out, once you've taken out those Flak guns.";
BRIEFINGC1M4_7 = "\cCWe'll be airdropping you and \cQCpt. Ryan\cC under the cover of darkness - he will join you in the field this time, so watch each other's backs! Approaching the dam shouldn't be any trouble, but expect heavy resistance when you get there. As always, good luck, \cPWill\cC!";

BRIEFINGC1M5_1 = "\cCSuperb effort, \cPBlazkowicz\cC. Our \"bouncing bomb\" successfully destroyed the dam. Now, to our next mission: no less than the liberation of \cBParis\cC! But \cRHitler\cC's appetite for destruction is insatiable. He'd destroy the city before conceding it to us.";
BRIEFINGC1M5_2 = "\cCEnemy forces are concentrated in a plaza on the Seine, near which \cQJuliette Bertrand\cC has established a \cQResistance\cC hideout. You will infiltrate \cBParis\cC, rendezvous with \cQBertrand\cC, and secure the plaza while preventing the destruction of its main bridge.";
BRIEFINGC1M5_3 = "\cCThen, secure the nearby buildings and the network of catacombs connecting them; the enemy uses this network to move men and supplies. Meanwhile, we can expect the \cRNazis\cC to try to re-take the plaza; you must be ready to hold the area after you've secured it.";
BRIEFINGC1M5_4 = "\cCAs you secure the area, we'll be preparing to deploy \cQAllied reinforcements\cC to help defend the plaza. Also, \cQBertrand\cC tells us the enemy has set up a \cFNebelwerfer\cC artillery gun in the plaza. This \cFgun\cC would prove helpful if we're able to recover it intact.";
BRIEFINGC1M5_5 = "\cCThe \cRNazis\cC know this and will likely try to destroy it during their counter-attack, so defend the \cFgun\cC and hold the plaza! Oh, \cQAscher\cC had an important update for you about the \cBTunis\cC files you recovered; speak to him if you haven't already. Dismissed!";
BRIEFINGC1M5_6 = "\cCI can tell you're worried about our French warrior princess, \cPWill\cC! Look at it this way: Once we help liberate \cBParis\cC, just imagine how grateful and impressed she'll be with you, eh buddy? You oughta ask her if she has a cute friend for ol' \cQDirty Douglas\cC...";
BRIEFINGC1M5_7 = "\cCAnyway, you'll sneak in through the sewers. They'll lead you to the hideout where \cQShotglass\cC is holed up with the \cQResistance\cC, under the \cBbarber shop\cC. She'll give you the rundown on the situation and you can get on to killing \cRNazis\cC! Let's move out!";

BRIEFINGC1M6_4 = "\cCThis spear must be the artifact that the \cRNazis\cC are searching for. Legend says that the spear's power enabled the Knights Templar to break the siege of \cBAntioch\cC in 1098. Then, to keep it safe, the Knights hid the spear - in \cBTunis!\cC";
BRIEFINGC1M6_5 = "\cCThe \cRNazis\cC believe the legends, and all their hope is in this artifact. Return to \cBTunis\cC. The \cFdisc\cC will unlock the way to the \cFspear\cC; retrieve it before the \cRNazis\cC do. This will certainly crush their already-shaken morale. Dismissed!";

A couple of years ago, I even assisted Konrad Zuse's research but, well... one or two drinks got in between things... and now, here I am, at your service, \cPCaptain\cC, be it gathering intel or assisting with technical issues!

These gents sure get talkative after seven or eight beers, even the high-ranking fellows!\n\n\cCI've worked with the kind of technology you discovered in that facility. In bygone days I was part of a special group of engineers, researching and developing weapons for the U.S. Air Corps. No matter how many breakthroughs we made, the German engineers were always a step ahead, and what you saw in that facility proves it still holds true.\n\n\cCSir, pardon my frankness, but you should come touch base with me every now and then - I'll be keeping my eyes and ears open, and I just might learn something you'd like to hear.

I mean, 'New Berlin', what the heck?!...\n\n\cCI heard you've been collecting \cFMayan Artifacts\cC for \cQProfessor Gutenberg\cC for a while now. Believe it or not, call me a drunken idiot but \cU*hic*\cC ... Long before the first European explorers set foot in the new world, the Aztecs and Maya were already advanced civilizations.
