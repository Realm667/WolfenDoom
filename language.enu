BRIEFINGC1M1_1 = "\cCIt's splendid to have you back with us, \cPBlazkowicz\cC. I hope the boys here at headquarters took a moment to help you get settled in. \cQCaptain Blake\cC was certainly glad to see you join our little force. Now then, with formalities dealt with, let's discuss the first mission we have for you. Our intelligence sources have recently intercepted a German communique between Nazi offices in Tunis and Berlin.";
BRIEFINGC1M1_2 = "\cCAccording to those reports, the \cRNazis\cC have deployed an entire division to the outskirts of \cBTunis\cC, headed by \cRGeneral Fettgesicht\cC, with the goal of establishing a small outpost near an archaeological excavation site.";
BRIEFINGC1M1_3 = "\cQThe brass at Allied High Command\cC finds it very unusual that \cRHitler\cC would send \cRFettgesicht\cC, head of the Afrika Korps, with that much manpower to a simple outpost in Tunisia during such a crucial stage of the war.";
BRIEFINGC1M1_4 = "\cCYour first mission is to make landfall at the \cBTunis\cC and infiltrate the Nazi offices and locate any \cFinformation\cC that will allow us to determine \cRHitler's\cC scheme.";
BRIEFINGC1M1_5 = "\cCSuffice it to say, we are counting on you, \cPBlazkowicz\cC. Failure is not an option. However, you are our best weapon and if anyone can accomplish this, it's you. Time is of the essence, so meet \cQCaptain Douglas Blake\cC at the headquarters gate for further specifics. You are dismissed!";
BRIEFINGC1M1_6 = "\cPBlazkowicz\cC you really had me worried for a while. I wasn't sure I'd be able to pull you back in, but here you are! For your first mission, we have orders to airdrop you at 0300 hours on the outskirts of \cBTunis\cC. You'll need to keep your wits about you, since the night watch will still be present. Use the night shadows and stealth to your advantage.";
BRIEFINGC1M1_7 = "\cCMake sure you've got your sidearm ready and mission objectives memorized. Once you've finished those objectives, rendezvous with at the extraction point near the \cBeastern gate\cC. Now give 'em Hell, \cPBlazkowicz\cC!";

BRIEFINGC1M2_1 = "\cCExcellent work in \cBTunis\cC, \cPBlazkowicz\cC. \cQCaptain Douglas Blake\cC had nothing but glowing praise for your performance, friendship notwithstanding. In case you're wondering, the \cFcaptured documents\cC have been sent posthaste to our top cryptologists. With any luck, they'll soon uncover what the Jerries are up to.";
BRIEFINGC1M2_2 = "\cCWith that in mind, we cannot rest on our laurels just yet. Our security and communications department has intercepted and decrypted an alarming message with the Enigma machine. Recently, one of our operatives, \cQCaptain James Ryan\cC has been captured by the Gestapo during a reconnaissance mission in \cBFrance\cC! Currently, he is in the custody of the Schutzstaffel. This presents a great risk, as they are not unfamiliar with advanced interrogation techniques, potentially gathering a great deal of information if \cQRyan's\cC cyanide capsule has been confiscated.";
BRIEFINGC1M2_3 = "\cCOur intel indicates he has been transferred to the infamous prison, \cASaint-Jean\cC. Its fame is due in no small part to never having had a successful escape attempts by any prisoners of war incarcerated there. It goes without saying that no one has been bold enough to attempt a rescue mission at \cASaint-Jean\cC, either. We both know that's because they haven't seen you attempt it yet, \cPBlazkowicz\cC!";
BRIEFINGC1M2_4 = "\cCIt's time to put an end to this prison's claim to fame. Your mission is to infiltrate \cASaint-Jean\cC and liberate Cpt. \cQJames Ryan\cC! You have carte blanche to do whatever is necessary to prevent the Nazis from extracting intel from \cQCaptain James Ryan\cC and return here with him alive.";
BRIEFINGC1M2_5 = "\cCAlthough you have been trained to resist interrogation, you must certainly comprehend the cruelty and horror that awaits if should you fail, \cPBlazkowicz\cC. Accordingly, you have been provided a standard issue cyanide capsule to be used at your own discretion. It is imperative that you meet \cQCaptain Blake\cC. You are dismissed!";
BRIEFINGC1M2_6 = "\cCThings have certainly gotten heated quickly, eh \cPBlazkowicz\cC? Of course, the last time we were in France trying to get into anything named Jean, we weren't talking about any saint! In all seriousness, be careful. I'd hate to lose a good friend like you so quickly after so long. We haven't even had Shotglass pour us a well-deserved drink yet. Anyway, I'm not good at long goodbyes, so let's go!";
BRIEFINGC1M2_7 = "\cCAll right, this is it. At this point, we're very deep in enemy territory, so proceed carefully and quietly. With any luck, we should be able to get both you and \cQRyan\cC extracted in one piece. Make those bastards pay for taking one of ours... but don't do anything stupid, okay?";

BRIEFINGC1M3_1 = "\cCStupendous result, \cPBlazkowicz\cC, I'm sure the Jerries didn't expect you to take the fight to their doorstep. Thanks to you, \cQCaptain James Ryan\cC is safely in the infirmary recovering. Once he's on the mend and had a chance to get pint or two, he'll be debriefed.";
BRIEFINGC1M3_2 = "\cCIt seems all we can do is breathe a sigh of relief one moment only to hold it again in the next. We will soon be taking part in the largest Allied amphibious invasion this war has seen; \cBOperation: Overlord\cC.";
BRIEFINGC1M3_3 = "\cCNew intel captured by MI6 indicates that we have another pressing concern, however. The heavily fortified \cQAtlantic Wall\cC off the shores of \cBNormandy\cC are lined with powerful 56mm guns that will turn the beachhead into a slaughtering ground. The Allies won't even have a prayer's chance before joining the battle.";
